### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:man_technologist: I'm Adam Benhrima, a software engineer at [SMP Group](https://www.smpgroup.co.uk/)!

:briefcase: At work, I specialise in automating workflows and boosting efficiency using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and [VBA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/). I also modernise our systems with [Javascript](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), transitioning from paper-based to eco-friendly digital platforms.

:man_student: I learned to code at [@Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/)'s Software Engineering bootcamp, where I extensively worked with [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) on the front-end and leveraged [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to create full-stack applications!

:seedling: I'm currently exploring [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

:incoming_envelope: Reach out if you would like to collaborate; my email is on my profile!
