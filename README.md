### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:man_student: I'm Adam Benhrima, a recent [@Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/) Software Engineering bootcamp graduate and Javascript enthusiast!

:bulb: During my bootcamp, I spent a lot of time working with [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) on the front-end, while utilising the powers of [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) & [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to create Full Stack applications!

:briefcase: Currently employed at [SMP Group](https://www.smpgroup.co.uk/) as a Junior Developer, I work mainly with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), & [VBA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/) to help automate workflows and drive efficiency.

:seedling: I'm currently exploring [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) & [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

:incoming_envelope: Reach out if you would like to collab, my email is on my profile!
